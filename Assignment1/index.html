            <h2>Prologue & Part 1: The Journey</h2>

            <p>
                In an alternate universe, there lies an externally innocuous solar system that looks much
                like ours: a sun-like star, several planets orbiting it, and many more satellites orbiting them. On
                the closest habitable planet from said star, there lives a race of elf-like beings governed by a
                kingdom that spans the whole of the planet. The warrior-princess of this kingdom, Hoshiko, is
                gifted with the ability to see the future through dreams. This along with the just governance of
                her parents—the king Makan and the queen Hara—have helped to prevent many a catastrophe.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, one fateful night, Hoshiko's dream-premonitions foresaw a catastrophe hitherto
                unheard of. She saw that their solar system's star was nearing the end of its life, and would thus
                soon expand into a red giant and consume them all in an unstoppable nuclear blaze. Waking up
                in a cold sweat, she knew she would have to inform her parents as she had always done. This
                time, though, she knew not what could be done to avert it. Something such as this, purely
                governed by the laws of nature, seemed all but inevitable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Upon telling her father later that morning, she was reminded of the legend of an advanced
                alien race that used to inhabit the planet furthest from their star. Unlike the rest of the races that
                inhabited the several habitable planets of this solar system—it had a habitable zone far larger
                than ours—they were the only ones that were not native. Instead, they came from an unknown
                source on unimaginably large spaceships and terraformed the furthest planet. What was once a
                desolate desert of black sand soon became a suitable home for these strange creatures. During
                their sojourn on this planet, they fashioned many seemingly-impossible devices that appeared to
                bend the laws of physics themselves to their will; many of these devices were documented
                during the early days of the solar system's interplanetary alliance and said documents were
                preserved within the kingdom's royal archives. One such device was supposedly capable of
                extending a star's lifespan by imparting it with more nuclear fuel; however, how it did this and
                whether it was still on the planet was unknown.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thus, Hoshiko knew what she had to do: going planet by planet, she would embark on a
                quest to retrieve this mythical device and bring it home to save her race from impending
                extinction. Due to the now-shaky relations held by some members of the interplanetary alliance
                and the fact that the furthest planet was reverted back to a desolate wasteland after the aliens left,
                she knew that it would be arduous. Regardless, she was determined, as she knew there was no
                other way. Accompanied by a Pixa—a member of the færie-like race that also inhabited the
                planet along with the elf-like race—she set off soon after her fateful meeting with her parents.

            <h2>Part 2: The Return</h2>

            <p>
                After traversing each planet one-by-one and encountering both friendly and hostile
                neighbors, Hoshiko and Pixa finally came upon Kena, the long-abandoned planet at the edge of
                their solar system. After some time, they finally found the ruins of the alien's civilization, now
                dilapidated from centuries of neglect. Copious searching finally revealed what they were looking
                for after all this time: the solar sceptre. The pair were ecstatic to find that what they traveled for
                so long for actually existed, but their celebration was cut short as they soon discovered what
                made the aliens leave after all. By traveling in the crypts, they had awakened a cosmic dragon
                that slumbered in a pocket dimension that could only be accessed by a portal of its own creation,
                and now they were forced to confront it if they wished to return home alive.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the most difficult and taxing battle of their lives, Hoshiko and Pixa successfully
                slayed the dragon, but not without sustaining heavy injuries. This leads them to faint, and when
                they awake, they find themselves trapped within the dragon's pocket dimension. Traveling along
                its labyrinthine pathways, they scramble to find a way out—and home.

            <h2>Part 3: The War</h2>

            <p>
                After what felt like an eternity, Hoshiko and Pixa finally found a way out of the dragon's
                pocket dimension. However, once they do, they are greeted by a planetary civil war waged against Hoshiko's parents by a band of rebels.
                Now, the world's attention is turned away from the impending catastrophe that Hoshiko fought so long to avert.
                Thus, she then finds herself in a race against time to end the war before their star actually dies, or else her quest for the sceptre 
                would be all for naught, and all that she and everyone else held dear would cease to exist.

                    A diagram showing the approximate scale of our solar system before and after our sun becomes a red giant. Since Hoshiko's star is a
                    sun-like star and her planet is an Earth-like planet, I believe this does a good job of illustrating what will happen if Hoshiko fails.
